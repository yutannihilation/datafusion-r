DataFusion Python API: https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion-python/

## What's this?

The main purpose of this repo is to see if [the savvy framework](https://github.com/yutannihilation/savvy) has enough features for mildly complex usages. Especially,

* to check if savvy can convert an external pointer or ALTREP that an other package defines. e.g. <https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion-python/>
* to figure out what async support is supposed to be e.g. <https://github.com/yutannihilation/savvy-async-poc?

## Code

```{r}
library(datafusionr)

x <- arrow::as_record_batch(mtcars)

ctx <- session_context()
df <- ctx$create_data_frame(as_array_stream(x), table_name = "mtcars")
df
```
